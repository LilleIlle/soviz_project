# # 5. Visualizations
# Bar charts, histograms and maps are the primary type of visualizations used.
# Bar charts are chosen for their superior readability—they convey categorized quantities concisely.
# Conversely, charts such as pie and donut charts are _not_ used.
# The goal has been to keep the data–ink ratio [Tufte] high and the color scheme consistent throughout the project.
#
# In the figure in Section 3 showing the plot of number of crashes and average speeds a twin y-axis chart is used to combine a histogram with a trend line.
# The striking red color of the trend line is also used for coloring the y-axis itself, rendering legends surplus.
#
# In Section 3 a scatter chart is used to investigate the correlation between two attributes.
#
# For geospatial data, map visualizations are naturally used to convey the locality of crashes as well
# as heat maps showing the concentration of various events. For showing the temporal development of crashes,
# some of the maps are augmented with animations scrubbing through time. Animations are thus an evident choice for temporal visualizations.
