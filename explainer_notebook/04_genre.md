# Genre

Th website is a single frame _Magazine Style_, where each visualization is embedded in some text either describing or discussing the foundings made for the given visualization.
In extend to the magazine style, the _Film/Video/Animation_ genre is used to show the reader how the distribution of crashes changes for different time intervals.

The structure for this project consists of elements from all three categories of _Narrative Structure_ (Figure 7 in [Segal and Heer]).
The scenes follow a **linear ordering** to ensure that the path viewers take through the visualization is the one prescribed by the authors.

**Interactivity** – such as _Hover Highlighting_ and _filtering_ – has been utilized for relevant plots in order to engage the user to form their own data diagnostics and pattern discovery.

Finally **messaging** in the form of _Captions / Headlines_, _Introductory Text_ and **Summary / Synthesis** has been used to communicate observations and commentary to the viewer.

In terms of Visual Narrative tools (Figure 7 in [Segal and Heer]), highlighting (e.g. feature distinction, motion and zooming) is employ to help direct the viewer’s attention to particular elements of the different scenes.
